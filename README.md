# Video Management Application

## Overview
This is a full-stack video management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) with Docker for local containerization. It allows users to upload, view, and manage their own video collections.

## Features
- User authentication (JWT-based)
- Video upload from Google Drive
- Video filtering and pagination
- Video metadata storage
- Video player for direct viewing
- Responsive frontend built with React
- Dockerized services using Docker Compose

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your machine

### Steps to run the application locally:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/video-management-app.git
   cd video-management-app
Build and start all services using Docker Compose:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose up --build
This will start the frontend, backend, and database services in separate containers.

Once everything is up and running, you can access:

Frontend at http://localhost:3000
Backend at http://localhost:5000
To stop the containers, run:

bash
Copy code
docker-compose down
Configuration
The backend is connected to a MongoDB database running in a Docker container.
The frontend communicates with the backend through the environment variable REACT_APP_API_URL.
Technologies Used:
MongoDB for storing video metadata
Express.js for the backend API
React for the frontend UI
JWT for user authentication
Docker for containerization
Backend Structure
controllers/: Contains business logic for user authentication and video management.
models/: Defines the database schemas (User and Video models).
routes/: Contains the API routes for user authentication and video operations.
middleware/: Middleware for authentication.
server.js: The main entry point for the backend server.
Frontend Structure
components/Auth/: Contains components for user login and registration.
components/Video/: Contains components for video upload, list, and player.
api.js: Handles API requests to the backend.
Deployment
This application is Dockerized, and you can deploy it to cloud platforms like AWS or Azure using Docker containers.
